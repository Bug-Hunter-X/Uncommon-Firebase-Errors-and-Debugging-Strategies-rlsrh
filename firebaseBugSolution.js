To address permission-denied errors, carefully review and adjust your Firebase security rules to allow the necessary data access. For data type mismatches, meticulously check data types when interacting with the database, ensuring they conform to the expected format. Asynchronous operations need to be handled using promises or async/await to prevent race conditions. Ensure that all asynchronous operations complete before accessing their results. Finally, always use the latest stable versions of the Firebase SDK and its dependencies. Keep your project's dependencies updated to avoid compatibility issues and leverage bug fixes.
